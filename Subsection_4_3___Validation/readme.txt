Here you can see all the images as complement to Figures 12-13 of the paper.
In Savonius_and_WindBooster folder is Ensamblaje1.SLDASM, open it in Solidworks 
for execute the simulations.
Notes:
a) Savonius alone: The file includes two elements, select only the Savonius croquis
to obtain these results.
b) Savonius with Wind Booster: Add the Wind Booster croquis and repeat the simulations.
c) See configuration in SolidWorks_FlowAnalysis_Configuration.pdf
