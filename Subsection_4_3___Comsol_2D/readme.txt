1) In Figures_14_All_angles.pdf you can se all the conducted experiments to obtain the torque values.
2) For the COMSOL simulations, use:
a) NoBooster_Sav_CFDv5_2.mph for Savonius alone.
b) windBooster_Sav_CFDv5.mph for Savonius with Wind Booster. 
c) Use General procedure to calculate the torque on the Savonius rotor.pdf to obtain de torque values.
